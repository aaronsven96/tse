# Testing
We made our executable using make.
We tested out iterators in our data structures.
We tested our indexer with over 300 of our crawler files.
We tested indexer using his data files at multiple depths.
We also checked the data using indextest. We used valgrind and got rid of all
data leaks and errors.

We included indext.txt which is the file our indexer made
We also included index2.txt which is the ouput of our indextest
